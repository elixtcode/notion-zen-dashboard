# Project: Notion Zen Dashboard

This is a web app built using modern tools like **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, scaffolded and iteratively developed using the **Lovable AI assistant** to streamline frontend setup and styling. The goal is to build an embeddable dashboard for Notion that tracks personal productivity metrics (e.g., focus time, time spent per task) in a visually appealing and responsive layout.

While Lovable was used to assist with initial scaffolding and prompting, all code was reviewed, customized, and extended manually using my own logic and design decisions.

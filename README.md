# Project: Notion Zen Dashboard

This is a mobile-friendly web app built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, designed to embed seamlessly in Notion. I used an AI-assisted tool to generate the initial layout scaffold to speed up development, but all core components, logic, and styling were designed, written, and refined manually through GitHub.

The goal is to track personal productivity metrics such as focus time and time spent per task through a clean, responsive interface. Through this project, I applied key concepts in React and TypeScript, including state management, component logic, and type-safe development practices.

## Features & Key Learnings

- Built a timer-based tracker using `setInterval`, `useState`, and `useEffect` to monitor task durations in real time  
- Created and validated forms using **React Hook Form**, including error handling and dynamic field control  
- Customized responsive UI with **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui** components  
- Managed dynamic state and conditional UI rendering using core React hooks  
- Designed and deployed the dashboard with full **Notion embed compatibility**  
- Strengthened my understanding of modern frontend architectures and type-safe development workflows

## About the Setup

To accelerate initial layout setup, I used an AI-assisted tool (Lovable) to scaffold the basic file structure and layout components. From there, I manually implemented all logic, component behavior, and custom design—coding directly in GitHub using a modular, maintainable structure with full version control.

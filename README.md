# Project: Notion Zen Dashboard

This is a mobile-friendly web app built using modern tools like React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The initial scaffolding was assisted by AI-assisted tools to speed up the setup and styling process, but all components, logic, and refinements were developed, reviewed, and customized directly in GitHub using my own design and implementation decisions.

The goal is to build an embeddable dashboard for Notion that tracks personal productivity metricsâ€”such as focus time and time spent per taskâ€”in a clean, responsive, and visually engaging layout. This project demonstrates my ability to build real-world frontend applications with a type-safe, component-based architecture.

## Features I Added / Customized
- Implemented basic time tracker to log time spent on each task
- Custom form validation with React Hook Form
- Dynamic theming via Tailwind and shadcn/ui
- Custom state handling with useState and useEffect
- Published live using Lovable-hosted URL
- Designed for Notion Embeds
  
## What I Learned
Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:
- Structuring and styling React apps with modern UI frameworks
- Managing dynamic form data and component state
- Experimented using AI-assisted tools for rapid UI scaffolding
- Deploying web apps with rapid iteration and visual testing

## Project Highlights & Learnings
- Scaffolded the project using Vite an an AI-assisted layout starter
- Customized layout with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
- Built and validated forms using React Hook Form
- Handled dynamic state with useState/useEffect
- Explored prompt-driven workflows to accelerate early prototyping
- Deployed the dashboard with Notion embed support
  
## About the Setup
To accelerate early layout work, I used an AI-assisted tool for frontend assistanceâ€”to scaffold the initial boilerplate. From there, I manually built out all logic, UI components, and styling decisions to match the projectâ€™s goals and design.
